## 👋 About Me  

Hi, I’m **Brody** – computer science student by day, rock-climbing, coffee-guzzling code gremlin by night. I study at the **University of Missouri-Columbia**, where I juggle full-stack development projects, side quests in AI-driven livestock analytics, and the occasional philosophical crisis over semicolon placement.  

My background's got more layers than an onion wearing a Patagonia fleece: health research, hotel valet hustle, and a stint abroad in London where I coded by day and dodged double-decker buses by night. I thrive on **solving gnarly problems**, **writing clean, punchy code**, and **collaborating with people who don’t take themselves too seriously but take their work very seriously**.  

If you’re looking for someone who can commit to the grind, deploy Docker containers like a madman, and also make puns about Java (the language *and* the coffee)—we might just be a match made in GitHub.

## 🛠️ Projects That Keep Me Up at Night (In a Good Way)  

### 📈 AI-Modeled Pig Data Management System  
**Tech Stack**: Next.js, Express.js, MongoDB  
- Built a farm research platform that makes pigs look like data science stars  
- Designed schema for timestamped pig posture sorcery  
- Handled AI-data ingestion faster than you can say “oink!”  
- Visualized batch analytics because pigs deserve graphs too  

### 🏥 ICARE Health Management System  
**Tech Stack**: Django, Docker, HTML/CSS  
- Secured health data with more layers than a security onion

### 🗣️ Article Translation App  
**Tech Stack**: React, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB  
- Built a real-time Spanish-to-English translator (no, Google Translate didn’t help)  
- Frontend dev lead: optimized UI/UX like a caffeinated wizard  
- Smooth API integration so fast it practically speaks fluent Español  

### 📚 Library Management System  
**Tech Stack**: MySQL, PHP (don’t judge me)  
- Designed a DBMS to keep overdue books in check  
- Engineered queries with precision to avoid librarian rage
