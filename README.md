## 👋 About Me  

Hi, I’m **Brody** – computer science student by day, coffee-addict code gremlin by night. I study at the **University of Missouri-Columbia**, where I juggle full-stack development projects, side quests in AI-driven livestock analytics, and the occasional philosophical crisis over semicolon placement.  

If you’re looking for someone who can commit to the grind, deploy Docker containers like a madman, and also make puns about Java (the language *and* the coffee)—we might just be a match made in GitHub.
